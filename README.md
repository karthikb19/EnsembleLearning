# EnsembleLearning
This repo has various implementations of Ensemble Learning technqiues

Most implementations use scikit-learn but for boosting I do use XGBoost

# Learning Path:
To learn more go through the notebooks in the following order
1. Voting Classifier
2. Bagging/Pasting
3. Random Forests
4. Boosting(Gradient Boosting, XGBoost)
5. Stacking


# ToDo:
* Adding "oob score" to the Bagging/Pasting repo
* Going indepth about each technique and clean up the notebooks
