# EnsembleLearning
This repo has various implementations of Ensemble Learning technqiues

Most implementations use scikit-learn but for boosting I do use XGBoost

# Notebooks
* Voting Classifier 
* Bagging/Pasting
* Random Forests
* Boosting(Gradient Boosting, XGB)
* Stacking

# ToDo:
* Adding "oob score" to the Bagging/Pasting repo
* Going indepth about each technique and clean up the notebooks
